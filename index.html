<h3><a id="Aims and scope" class="anchor" href="#Aims_and_scope" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aims and scope</h3>

          <p> Forecasting the future of ecological variables, for example the abundance of a species, the composition of a community, or the level of some ecosystem processes and service, is an increasingly important pursuit. From an applied perspective, forecasts can be used to assist decision making and policy formation. From a pure perspective, forecasting is challenging, interesting, and stimulating, providing a synthetic arena for many types of ecological knowledge (e.g., demography, interactions, evolution), often involving couple of mathematical models and empirical data. Ecological forecasting, the journal provides a venue for articles concerning all aspects of ecological forecasting, and a focal point for reading about the same. </p>
          
          <p>Ecological forecasting "publishes" articles that are already published elsewhere. Any type of article can be published, so long as it already has a DOI (digital object identifier. Preprint servers, such as biorxiv, issue DOIs to articles published there. Other journals, such as Nature, Science.</p>

<h3><a id="Submit_a_paper" class="anchor" href="#Author_guidelines" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Submit a paper</h3>

          <p> If you are the author: First, if your article does not yet have a DOI, get it one. For example, publish it in bioRxiv, Nature, Science, or Ecology Letters. Then send an email to *** with a link to the published article, asking for it to be considered for publication in Ecological Forecasting. Then sit back and watch the editorial process unfold on the web page that will be sent back to you in a reply email.</p>
          
          <p> If you are not the author: You can submit an article so long as it has a DOI. Send an email to <a href="mailto:owen.petchey@ieu.uzh.ch?Subject=Ecological%20Forecasting%20Submission"></a> containing a link to the published article (no other information is required). Then sit back and watch the editorial process unfold on the web page that will be sent back to you in a reply email.</p>
